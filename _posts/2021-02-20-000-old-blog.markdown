## Adventures In Cloud blog

Earlier i used to maintain [AdventuresInCloud](https://adventuresincloud.wordpress.com/) blog on wordpress.com website

However, i felt it constraint by some limitataions and usually the way to get away from it was to upgrade my subscription, which began costing more money. Since i had no plans to monitize it, i started looking for alternative when i wanted to resume blogging.

That is when i found a better way to create my blog **for free** and without any limitations.
It took a lot of work, but in the end the results were satisfactory.

So this blog is made using **Jekyll** and hosted free of cost on GitHub using **GitHub Pages**.

Below are the links to articles from my old blog.
